	and then put the URL in parentheses.](https://like.that)

	~~To make strikethoughs put ~~ around your text.~~

	![To put images in Markdown is very similar to links except that     
	you put a ! at the beginning and instead of a website URL you indicate    
	the path to the image](/image/myImage.jpg)

	and finaly <em>you</em> can embedd <strong>HTML</strong> in Markdown.
